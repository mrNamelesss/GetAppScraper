0. This is Node.js app. It is expected that you know how to prepare (>npm i) and use it (>node app).
1. Before starting an app, make sure DATABASE_HOST, DATABASE_PORT, DATABASE_NAME and DATABASE_TABLE_NAME are correct. You can change them in app.js.
2. Application remembers it's state, so it continues scraping after rerunning from the moment it failed last time.
3. It saves the state in tasks.json, so please don't modify this file.
4. You can terminate the process at any time by pressing CTRL+C, and the app saves it's state before exiting.
